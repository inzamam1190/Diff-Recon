# Diff-Recon: Zero-Shot MRI Reconstruction

## Project Goal
Building a **Score-Based Diffusion Model** to reconstruct high-fidelity MRI images from undersampled k-space data using Langevin Dynamics.

## Current Phase: Phase 1
- [x] Environment Setup
- [ ] Data Loading & K-Space Visualization
- [ ] Basic IFFT Reconstruction

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the loader: `python src/loader.py`
